# FriendlyBot

Hello, friend! You've reached the home of FriendlyBot, a Tak bot
designed to be a tool to help you learn the game of Tak.

# Playing FriendlyBot

You can play games against FriendlyBot on playtak.com. Log in and find
the bot's name under "Join game". If it's not there, it might be
occupied right now -- it can only play one person at a time right now.

# Changing the difficulty level

FriendlyBot supports playing at a number of different difficulty
levels.

To change the difficulty level, just say

"FriendlyBot: level <level>" in chat. It supports a number of levels,
from 1 up through 9 or higher (I will still be tweaking the levels).

The levels have somewhat different styles of play, in addition to
being harder or easier, so try a few different levels, even if you're
struggling with one.

If you're playing the bot, you can even change the difficulty level
mid-game.
